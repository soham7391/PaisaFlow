# PaisaFlow
Hackathon project
Freelancers in India lose an average of 5-7 hours per week on manual administrative tasks and often face payment delays of 45-90 days due to improper documentation. PaisaFlow is a professional finance management platform designed to solve this by replacing complex accounting software with an automation-first workflow. Unlike generic global tools, PaisaFlow is hardcoded with Indian tax logic to specifically address the unique compliance hurdles faced by independent professionals.

The system features a smart "Place of Supply" detection engine that automatically calculates correct tax components (IGST vs. CGST/SGST) to generate legally compliant, PDF-ready invoices in seconds. By integrating real-time tax estimation and expense tracking into a privacy-first, local architecture, PaisaFlow allows users to manage their "Net Profit" without requiring any accounting knowledge or cloud lock-in.
